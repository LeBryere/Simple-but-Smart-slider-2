        Overall, the code is a simple but effective way to make pages more interactive and catch visitors'
        attention.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the beginning of the function definition, we define an init() function that expects an item
          parameter. The function first selects all li elements within the item and sets some variables.
          These include the current variable that contains the current slide, the autoUpdate variable that
          holds a true value if automatic update is enabled, and a timeTrans variable that determines the
          interval for automatic update.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, we create a navigation menu that contains two buttons (prevbtn, nextbtn) and a counter.
          We add the menu to the item if there is more than one element. We set the current slide as the
          current class, and if there is more than one element, we set the last element as the prev_slide class.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, we define a navigate() function that performs navigation in the specified direction.
          We remove the current class of the current slide and determine the next or previous slide
          depending on the direction. Then, we set the appropriate classes for the elements and update the counter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, we add the event handlers. We add the mouseenter and mouseleave event handlers to the
          item to stop automatic update when the mouse enters the element and restart it when the mouse
          leaves the element. The autoUpdate variable is true by default, and if automatic update is enabled,
          we set the timer with the setInterval() function, which calls the navigate() function at the
          specified interval.
        </li>
        <li>
          We add event handlers for the prevbtn and nextbtn buttons, which perform navigation in the appropriate
          direction. We add a keyboard event handler that allows the user to navigate using the left and right
          arrows. Finally, we add touch event handlers.
        <li>
          Then, in the code snippet, we define the navigate function that is responsible for navigation.
          The function decides whether to flip left or right based on the value of the dir variable passed
          as a parameter. It also updates the value of the current variable accordingly. It sets the className
          values of the items in the list appropriately and updates the counter value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, we add event handlers for mouse movement and touch screen events. When pointing to the item
          element, we set the value of the autoUpdate variable to false, so automatic flipping stops. When the
          cursor is removed, the autoUpdate value returns to true, and automatic flipping continues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, we set up the timer responsible for automatic flipping, which navigates between slides according
          to the value of the timeTrans variable. When clicking on the prevbtn and nextbtn buttons, we call the
          navigate function, and we also handle navigation from the keyboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, we add event handlers for touch screen devices, which respond to swiping left and right
          and navigate between slides accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, the function calls the init function for all elements with the cd-slider class to initialize
          the slideshow on all appropriate elements.
        </li>
      </ul>
